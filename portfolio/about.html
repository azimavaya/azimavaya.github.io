            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Alina Zimavaya, and I am a junior at High Point University, majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Religion. I was born in Belarus, a small country with limited opportunities, which inspired me to move to the United States at 14 in pursuit of a brighter future. Adapting to a new culture and learning English from scratch was challenging, but I embraced it as part of my growth.</p>
            <p>I chose Computer Science because I enjoy problem-solving and pushing myself intellectually, and my goal is to merge my technical skills with creativity to develop solutions that make a real difference. Having witnessed economic hardship firsthand, I am deeply motivated to use technology to improve lives and create opportunities for others.</p>
            <p>Outside of academics, I stay active by playing football and volleyball and love spending time outdoors hiking. Writing poetry and essays allows me to express my thoughts, while reading helps me explore new ideas and perspectives. Creativity has always been an important part of who I am, and I believe blending it with my analytical skills will open doors to innovative solutions. My journey has shaped me into a determined and resilient individual, and I am eager to apply my experiences and knowledge to make a meaningful impact.</p>
