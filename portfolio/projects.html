            <h2>Project 1: The Spellchecker</h2>
            <img src="spellchecker.png" alt="Project 1" class="project-image">
            <p class="project-description">This C++ program implements a spell-checker using a hash table to efficiently store and look up words from a dictionary. The dictionary is loaded from a file, and each word is inserted into a custom hash table that uses a simple hash function based on the sum of ASCII values of characters modulo a predefined table size. The program allows users to input words and checks their validity by looking them up in the hash table. If the word is not found, the program generates suggestions for potential corrections by modifying one letter at a time and checking for valid dictionary entries. The performance of the word lookup and suggestion generation is measured in microseconds. The program continues running until the user types "quit," providing a basic, efficient interface for checking and correcting spelling.</p>

            <h2>Project 2: Quicksort Analysis</h2>
            <img src="quicksort.png" alt="Project 2" class="project-image">
            <p class="project-description">This C++ program implements the Quicksort algorithm and provides detailed tracking of key metrics such as the number of comparisons, swaps, and the number of times the Quicksort and Partition functions are called. The program uses recursive calls to sort different arrays, and each step is logged, including the pivot point for each partition and the low and high indices for each recursive call to Quicksort. The algorithm is tested on multiple arrays of varying order and size, including pre-sorted, reverse-sorted, and random data. For each array, the program outputs the sorted array, the total number of comparisons and swaps performed, and the time taken for sorting, measured in microseconds. This allows for a comprehensive analysis of the algorithm's efficiency and behavior on different inputs.</p>

            <h2>Project 3: Dijkstra Path Finder</h2>
            <img src="dijkstra.png" alt="Project 3" class="project-image">
            <p class="project-description">This C++ program implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in a graph. It tracks the time taken to compute the shortest paths and outputs the length of each shortest path, as well as the sequence of nodes forming the path. The program uses an adjacency matrix representation of the graph, where distances are stored, and unreachable nodes are represented by a large value (2000). The algorithm iterates through the graph, updating the shortest path estimates, and keeps track of the preceding node for each shortest path. After processing, it prints the shortest path and its distance for each node. The program is tested on two example graphs (Town One and Town Two), and for each, it displays the adjacency matrix, calculates the shortest paths using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, and prints the time taken for the calculation in microseconds.</p>
